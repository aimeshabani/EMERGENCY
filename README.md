# Solving Problems, Creating Opportunities with the Emergency App 

**We are thrilled to share the progress and vision behind the Emergency App, a transformative tool developed to tackle pressing challenges faced by refugees and underserved communities. With a focus on** **improving communication, showcasing talents, and fostering economic opportunities, the app is designed to connect people, services, and information effectively.**

# **Objective**

To connect people with those in need of their skills or services and to deliver important information to the right individuals at the right time.

Key Functionalities and Their Impact

---

1. Organizations:

How It Works: Enables trusted organizations like Alight, UNHCR, or WFP to share announcements, guidance, and opportunities directly with targeted users.
Example: UNHCR can notify refugees about upcoming aid distribution schedules, ensuring no one misses out.
Community Impact: Eliminates unreliable sources of information, ensuring important announcements reach the right audience promptly.
Why It Was Needed: Many refugees miss crucial updates due to misinformation or poor communication channels.

2. Influencers and Leaders:

How It Works: Community leaders, hospital supervisors, or local authorities can use this feature to share events, updates, or urgent alerts with their community. A message or media will either go to everyone in the zone, or they can choose specific receivers, such as doctors, butchers, or fruit deliverers.
Example: A commandant can share disaster response updates or a hospital can notify only doctors about an emergency.
Community Impact: Builds trust and ensures organized communication during critical moments.
Why It Was Needed: Current methods of communication often exclude key individuals, leading to confusion and delays in action.

3. Talents:

How It Works: Showcases individuals' skills in a gallery-like format, allowing users to connect with the right people for specific services or trades.
Example: A skilled welder can be discovered by someone needing repairs, cutting out the need for intermediaries.
Community Impact: Reduces unemployment and makes skilled labor more accessible.
Why It Was Needed: Talented individuals remain underutilized because they lack visibility in their community.

4. Small Sellers:

How It Works: Allows sellers to list items like fruits, vegetables, or services, and buyers within a 2-kilometer radius receive notifications.
Example: A vegetable seller can deliver produce to a buyer who was unaware of its availability nearby.
Community Impact: Reduces waste, improves local trade, and supports informal workers.
Why It Was Needed: Many sellers struggle to find buyers, while buyers assume items are unavailable, creating inefficiencies in local markets.

5. Zone Chats:

How It Works: Leaders or trusted users (with 50+ likes) can send messages to everyone in a zone or target specific groups like electricians or fruit vendors. This precision helps deliver relevant updates without overwhelming others with unrelated information.
Example: A parent who loses a child can alert everyone in the zone to assist in the search.
Community Impact: Enhances safety, community awareness, and rapid response in emergencies.
Why It Was Needed: Current emergency responses are often delayed due to the lack of efficient communication tools.

6. Proximity-Based Alerts:

How It Works: Notifies users about relevant items or services nearby.
Example: A mango seller walking near someone seeking mangoes will trigger alerts for both parties, facilitating a transaction.
Community Impact: Strengthens local connections and improves accessibility to goods and services.
Why It Was Needed: Many goods and services go unused because buyers and sellers fail to connect.

7. Message Relay Without Internet:

How It Works: Allows messages to hop between nearby devices until they reach the intended recipient, even without internet connectivity.
Example: A job listing can circulate through nearby devices until it reaches someone qualified for the role.
Community Impact: Enables communication in remote areas without relying on internet access.
Why It Was Needed: Internet access is often unreliable or unavailable in refugee settlements.

8. Server Matching for Jobs:

How It Works: The app and server continually match requests between job seekers and employers. This ensures even low-level jobs, like washing clothes, are filled by those desperate for survival occupations. Nearby work alerts also help connect people to immediate opportunities.
Example: A household in need of laundry assistance is matched with someone nearby seeking such work.
Community Impact: Reduces unemployment by connecting people with any available opportunities, ensuring economic survival for the most vulnerable.
Why It Was Needed: Many refugees struggle to find even basic work due to lack of visibility and access to potential employers.

Building Skills for the Future
In addition to the app's functionalities, we are committed to teaching other refugees the skills required to develop and manage such tools. These skills will not only empower them within the settlement but also prepare them to excel outside, keeping them competitive and up-to-date with modern technology.
